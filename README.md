A Big Integer library written in Rust

This is not yet usable - you can do the usual basic arithmetic operations apart from exponentiation, but the algorithms implemented so far are not the most efficient.

This is a way for me to dig into the inner workings of computer arithmetic and read some papers, but it might be interesting for other people learning about large number exact arithmetic.
